### 1) Research and Brainstorming

Each member researched ideas based on personal interests and real-world needs (IELTS preparation, drone delivery, supply chain).

The team gathered feedback from people about daily challenges and reviewed YouTube projects for inspiration.

### Brainstorming Sessions

* **October 26:** Initial idea generation
* **October 28:** Filtering and evaluation

### Techniques Used

* Open brainstorming
* Listing pros/cons for each idea
* "How Might We..." questions to discover innovation angles

---

### 2) Idea Evaluation

**Evaluation Criteria:** Feasibility, potential impact, technical alignment, scalability, time, and ease of implementation.

### Idea 1 – AI IELTS Assistant

A platform helping students prepare for IELTS using AI feedback on writing and speaking.

* **Strengths:** Clear target users; strong AI component.
* **Rejected Because:** Market is crowded; difficult to differentiate within short timeframe.

### Idea 2 – Smart Drone Delivery Simulation

A web app simulating drone delivery routes and services.

* **Strengths:** Visually appealing and technically interesting.
* **Rejected Because:** Users may assume real drone usage; not strongly connected to daily student needs.

### Idea 3 – Smart Pharma Demand & Inventory

A dashboard for pharmacies/warehouses to track medicine demand and reduce expiry waste.

* **Strengths:** Real supply-chain issue; strong business value.
* **Rejected Because:** Requires sensitive data and regulatory knowledge (SFDA), making it impractical.

### Idea 4 – **Dairy Direct** (Selected MVP)

A web platform connecting farms directly with consumers.

* **Strengths:** Clear problem; realistic scope; strong balance between frontend, backend, and analytics.
* **Decision:** Selected as the official MVP.

### 3) Decision and Refinement

### Final MVP: **Dairy Direct – Connecting Farms Directly with Consumers**

### Problem

Small and medium-sized farms rely on unorganized channels (WhatsApp, calls, middlemen). This creates inefficiency, lost orders, and product waste.

### Target Audience

* Farm owners (all types)
* Consumers who want local, fresh, traceable products directly from farms

### Key Features (MVP)

#### For Farms

* Register and manage products (milk, dates, fruits, vegetables, etc.)
* Set daily production capacity
* View simple demand analytics

#### For Consumers

* Browse available products
* Place and track orders (delivery or pickup)

### Enhancements Discussed

* Add daily capacity management to match supply and demand
* Keep analytics minimal in MVP
* Ensure mobile-friendly UI

### Expected Outcomes

* Reduce product waste through better demand matching
* Digitize operations for small and mid‑size farms
* Strengthen local farm‑to‑consumer channels

---

### 4) Idea Development Documentation

* All idea stages documented in Google Docs (brainstorming, pros/cons, meetings, decision).
* Final MVP summary includes rationale and expected impact.
* Clear documentation of team workflow to ensure smooth collaboration.
