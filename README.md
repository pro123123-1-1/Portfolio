##  Stage 1 – Team Formation & Idea Development

###  0. Team Formation
- **First meeting:** October 26 – On-site at Holberton Campus, 4:00 PM  
- **Communication:** WhatsApp group for daily coordination + weekly in-person meetings  

**👥 Team Members & Roles:**
- **Abdullah** – *Project Manager:* Leads coordination, meeting organization, and progress tracking.  
- **Raghad** – *Backend Developer:* Designs the database, builds APIs, and implements business logic.  
- **Haifa** – *Frontend Developer:* Builds and styles the user interface for both farm and consumer roles.  
- **Najwa** – *Data & Documentation Owner:* Handles analytics, testing data, and documentation (reports, README, etc.).

###  1. Research and Brainstorming
- Each member researched ideas based on personal interests and real-world needs (IELTS preparation, drone delivery, supply chain).  
- The team gathered feedback from people about daily challenges and reviewed YouTube projects for inspiration.  
- Two brainstorming sessions were held:  
  - **October 26:** Initial idea generation  
  - **October 28:** Filtering and evaluation  
- **Techniques used:**  
  - Open brainstorming  
  - Listing pros/cons for each idea  
  - “How Might We…” questions to uncover innovation angles

###  2. Idea Evaluation
**Evaluation Criteria:** Feasibility, potential impact, technical alignment, scalability, time, and ease of implementation.

#### Idea 1 – AI IELTS Assistant
A platform helping students prepare for IELTS with AI feedback on writing and speaking.  
**Strengths:** Clear target users (students, scholarship applicants); direct AI use.  
**Rejected because:** The market is already crowded with similar tools, making it difficult to stand out in a short timeframe.  

####  Idea 2 – Smart Drone Delivery Simulation
A web app simulating drone delivery routes and services (delivery, inspection, etc.).  
**Strengths:** Visually appealing and technically interesting.  
**Rejected because:** Users might expect real drones; less connected to daily life for a student project.  

####  Idea 3 – Smart Pharma Demand & Inventory
A dashboard for pharmacies/warehouses to monitor medicine demand and reduce expiry waste.  
**Strengths:** Real supply chain issue; valuable business insight.  
**Rejected because:** Requires sensitive data and regulatory knowledge (e.g., SFDA systems) — not practical for a student project.  

####  Idea 4 – Dairy Direct (Selected MVP)
A web platform connecting farms directly with end consumers. Consumers can order fresh products (dairy, fruits, vegetables, dates), and farms can manage capacity and orders.  
**Strengths:** Clear problem, realistic scope, defined users, and good balance between web development and data analytics.  
**Decision:** Selected as the final MVP idea.

###  3. Decision and Refinement
**Final MVP:** *Dairy Direct – Connecting Farms Directly with Consumers*  

**Problem:**  
Small and medium-sized farms rely on unorganized channels (WhatsApp, calls, or middlemen), leading to inefficiency, lost orders, and product waste.  

**Target Audience:**  
Farm owners (all types) and consumers who want local, fresh, and traceable products directly from farms.  

**Key Features (MVP):**
- **For Farms:**  
  - Register and manage products (milk, dates, fruits, vegetables, etc.)  
  - Set daily capacity and update orders  
  - View simple analytics about demand and top products  
- **For Consumers:**  
  - Browse products  
  - Place and track orders (delivery or pick-up option)  

**Enhancements Discussed:**
- Add daily capacity management to match production with demand  
- Design a simple, mobile-friendly interface  
- Keep analytics minimal at MVP stage to focus on functionality  

**Expected Outcomes:**
- Reduce product waste through better demand matching  
- Digitize small and mid-size farms’ operations  
- Strengthen direct local farm-to-consumer connections

###  4. Idea Development Documentation
- All stages documented in **Google Docs** (ideas, pros/cons, meeting notes, and decisions).  
- Summary of the selected MVP includes rationale and potential impact.  
- Overview of team formation and workflow to ensure transparency and collaboration.
